            tooltip="All pixels within the displayed area have been inverted. This value must not match if the User Agent has done some kind of content aware inversion such as one that preserves the images. Note: This is because the goal of this media feature is to enable authors to mitigate the undesirable effects of the non content aware approach that invert all the pixels. If the author were to take counter measures even in the content-aware cases, their counter measures and the UA�s would be at risk of cancelling each other." />

      <name value="none"

      <name value="initial-only"
            tooltip="Indicates that the user agent supports scripting of the page, and that scripting in the current document is enabled during the initial page load, but is not supported afterwards. Examples are printed pages, or pre-rendering network proxies that render a page on a server and send a nearly-static version of the page to the user. Should there be an explicit minimum threshold to meet before a UA is allowed to claim initial-only? Having one would mean authors would know what they can depend on, and could tailor their scripts accordingly. On the other hand, pinpointing that threshold is difficult: if it is set too low, the scripting facilities that authors can depend on may be to constrained to be practical, even though actual UAs may potentially all support significantly more. But trying to set it higher may cause us to exclude UAs that do support scripting at loading time, but restrict it in some cases based on complex heuristics. For instance, conservative definitions likely include at least running all inline scripts and firing the DOMContentLoaded event. But it does not seem useful for authors to constrain themselves to this if most (or maybe all) initial-only UAs also load external scripts (including async and defer) and fire the load event. On the other hand, requiring external scripts to be loaded and the load event to be fired could exclude UAs like Opera mini, which typically do run them, but may decide not to based on timeouts and other heuristics. &lt;https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/503&gt;" />
