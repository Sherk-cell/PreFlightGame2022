    <description><![CDATA[
      <p>The <b>:any-link</b> pseudo-class represents an element that acts as the source anchor of a hyperlink.
        For example, in HTML5, any &lt;a&gt;, &lt;area&gt;, or &lt;link&gt; elements with an href attribute are hyperlinks, and thus match
        :any-link.
        It matches an element if the element would match :link or :visited, equivalent to :matches(:link, :visited).</p>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <p>The matches-any pseudo-class, <b>:matches()</b>, is a functional pseudo-class taking a selector list as its argument.
        It represents an element that is represented by its argument.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[
      Input elements can sometimes show placeholder text as a hint to the user on what to type in. See, for example, the placeholder attribute in [HTML5]. The :placeholder-shown pseudo-class matches an input element that is showing such placeholder text.

    <description><![CDATA[
      <p>The ::placeholder pseudo-element represents placeholder text in an input field: text that represents the input and provides a hint to the user on how to fill out the form. For example, a date-input field might have the placeholder text “YYYY/MM/DD” to clarify that numeric dates are to be entered in year-month-day order.</p>
      <p>All properties that apply to the ::first-line pseudo-element also apply to the ::placeholder pseudo-element.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[The Specificity-adjustment pseudo-class, :something(), is a functional pseudo-class with the same syntax and functionality as :matches().
    Unlike :matches(), neither the :something pseudo-class, nor any of its arguments contribute to the specificity of the selector—its specificity is always zero.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The relational pseudo-class, :has(), is a functional pseudo-class taking a relative selector list as an argument.
    It represents an element if any of the relative selectors, when absolutized and evaluated with the element as the :scope elements, would match at least one element.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The :scope pseudo-class represents any element that is a :scope element. If the :scope elements are not explicitly specified,
    but the selector is scoped and the scoping root is an element, then :scope represents the scoping root; otherwise, it represents the root of the document (equivalent to :root).]]></description>
